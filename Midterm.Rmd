Visualization of Timberwolves offensive statistics  

- Shooting percentages are highly similar when the Timberwolves both win and lose 
- Little variation in points scored in both outcomes
- A variation is seen between the opponent's score in both outcomes 
  - Timberwolves win : Opponent's average score - 107
  - Timberwolves lose : Opponent's average score - 123
- This suggests the defense is going to depict the end score

Shot Location Graph

The data for the density plots was provided by the nbastats package in R. Data used included season year, shot location (provided by X and Y coordinates) and if the shot was made. The density of shot location was colored on a log scale due to high density in restricted region when compared to the rest of the court. Only half court was presented due to lack of points on opposing court side and simplicity. Marginal density plots show shots made (green) and missed (blue) over time. Plot animations vary by year in coordination with one another.

Generally, shot accuracy increased from 2000 to 2021, excluding a high peak seen from 2008 to 2010. In 2000, shots were taken from a general overlay of many locations, but it condenses to the lane and 3 point line as time increases. In all years, most shots were taken and made in the restricted region within 8 feet of the basket.


2021 Season Average

Additional ending score data was retrieved from landofbasketball.com and linked to nbastat data. Analysis of shooting percentages, total shots taken and end score separated by ending score result (win or lose) were analyzed. This analysis led to the conclusion that the offensive statistics don’t vary greatly between wins and losses. The average score of the Timberwolves being 113±4 while the opponent’s average score is 115±12. The greater standard deviation within the opponents scoring habits indicate defensive statistic should be analyzed for possible relationships to game losses.
